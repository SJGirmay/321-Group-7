To run the chatbot2.py make sure that chatbot2, intents.json and templates are in same directory and home.html must be located inside templates directory.

Use virtualenv. It lets you create python environment in a location you specify. Once the virtual environment is created, you can install Flask and your app inside this.

From the docs, virtualenv can be created locally, without installing the package globally:

$ curl -O https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/v/virtualenv/virtualenv-X.X.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz virtualenv-X.X.tar.gz
$ cd virtualenv-X.X
$ python virtualenv.py myVE
